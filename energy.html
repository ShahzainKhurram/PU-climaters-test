        <h2>International Climate Agreements</h2>
        <p>
            International climate agreements play a crucial role in global efforts to mitigate climate change by fostering cooperation among nations. 
            They set targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions, promote sustainable development, and support adaptation to climate impacts.
        </p>

        <h3>1. The Paris Agreement</h3>
        <p>
            Adopted in 2015, the Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
            Each country sets its own Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to outline its climate action goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The agreement encourages countries to regularly update their NDCs and report on progress, fostering transparency and accountability.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Kyoto Protocol</h3>
        <p>
            The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, was the first international treaty to commit countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
            It established legally binding targets for developed countries, recognizing their historical responsibility for emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the protocol faced challenges, including the withdrawal of major emitters, it set a precedent for future climate agreements and established carbon markets.
        </p>

        <h3>3. UN Climate Change Conferences (COP)</h3>
        <p>
            The Conference of the Parties (COP) is an annual meeting of countries that are parties to the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).
            These conferences serve as a platform for negotiations, progress updates, and setting new commitments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each COP builds on previous agreements and aims to enhance climate action globally, addressing emerging challenges and sharing best practices.
        </p>

        <h3>4. The Green Climate Fund (GCF)</h3>
        <p>
            Established to assist developing countries in their efforts to respond to climate change, the GCF supports projects that promote low-emission and climate-resilient development.
            The fund aims to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 from various sources, including public and private investments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Projects funded by the GCF include renewable energy initiatives, sustainable agriculture practices, and infrastructure improvements for climate resilience.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Global Methane Pledge</h3>
        <p>
            Launched during COP26, the Global Methane Pledge aims to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 compared to 2020 levels. 
            Over 100 countries have committed to this initiative, recognizing the urgent need to address methane's significant impact on climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pledge focuses on sectors such as agriculture, oil and gas, and waste management, where substantial reductions can be achieved through improved practices and technologies.
